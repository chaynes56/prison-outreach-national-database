## Background

> The experience of [teaching Centering Prayer in prisons](https://youtu.be/YMl0ZMxOuVI) has reinforced my belief in the extent to which God is prepared to go in order to reach people wherever they are. When we first introduced Centering Prayer in prisons, we notice that most men on the yard were not interested in coming to the chapel for religious services. They were beyond the reach of representatives of any religion. They were allergic to words like God, faith, forgiveness, and religion. They disliked the whole idea of religion and religious attitudes.
> 
> In Folsom State Prison in Represa, California, several of the inmates found the book [Open Mind, Open Heart](https://www.amazon.com/Open-Mind-Heart-20th-Anniversary/dp/1472972090/) and started practicing Centering Prayer on their own. They asked for a representative of [Contemplative Outreach](https://cpprisonoutreach.org/) to come in and give them a formal introductory workshop in Centering Prayer. The group came to be known as the Contemplative Fellowship. It met one night a week (provided there wasn't a lockdown), spent twenty minutes in silence and shared their experience. A core group took charge of teaching their fellow inmates how to do Centering Prayer. When other inmates saw changes for the better in the lives of these prisoners, some of them began to get interested in what they were doing to effect these changes. And as they began to attend the meetings and to experience silence themselves, they too began to change. They became less aggressive, angry, discouraged, more cheerful and considerate. Some even began to attend church services.

> God's determination to save everyone (1 Timothy 2:4) is not just to save people in general, but to transform each member of the human family in their inmost being and to bring them to the fullness of divine life and love. God seems to want us to extend every possible means in his power to touch people just where they are.
